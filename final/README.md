# Exercise 5

Fix the [urls.py](https://github.com/Speedy1991/strawberry-workshop/blob/master/core/urls.py#L4): `final.schema.schema`

## Interfaces

We finished this workshop :)

Whats left?

- What is this `info: Info` thing?
- Let's have a look at the customized asgi handler if time is left :)

## Why starlette?
I will cite the main reason from the [official page](https://www.starlette.io/):
> The modularity that Starlette is designed on promotes building re-usable components that can be shared between any ASGI framework. This should enable an ecosystem of shared middleware and mountable applications.
The clean API separation also means it's easier to understand each component in isolation.



## TODO

- [asgi.py](https://github.com/Speedy1991/strawberry-workshop/blob/master/strawberry_workshop/asgi.py)
