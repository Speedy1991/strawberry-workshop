# Exercise 5

Fix the [settings.py](https://github.com/Speedy1991/strawberry-workshop/blob/main/strawberry_workshop/settings.py#L4): `exercise5`

## Interfaces

Let's write our first interface. For less boilerplate I added a `socialClub(pk: Int)` field

## TODO

- [query.py](https://github.com/Speedy1991/strawberry-workshop/blob/main/exercise5/schema/types.py)
- [schema.py](https://github.com/Speedy1991/strawberry-workshop/blob/main/exercise5/schema/schema.py)
- [types.py](https://github.com/Speedy1991/strawberry-workshop/blob/main/exercise5/schema/types.py)

# Question:
Why could it be important to query the `__typename` in the interface? Think about autogenerated schemas for e.g. typescript
