## Query with Arguments and add custom fields

1) Query/Field Arguments
- Find all members in SocialClub's starting with a specified letter (optional filter)
- Find all socialClubs with at least x members (optional filter)

2) Mutation
- Finalize the create or update mutation 


3) Extra if you are really quick: Is it possible to mock/fake some Product data? Can you also mock/fake SocialClub data?
