# Exercise 3

Fix the [settings.py](https://github.com/Speedy1991/strawberry-workshop/blob/main/strawberry_workshop/settings.py#L4): `exercise3`

## Refactor

We have a lot of boilerplate code - we can do better!! Use two approaches:
- instanciate the type via a class method `from_obj`
- use strawberry `Private` fields


## TODO

- [types.py](https://github.com/Speedy1991/strawberry-workshop/blob/main/exercise3/schema/types.py)

## Questions

- What are the advantages/differences between `from_obj` and `Private`?
